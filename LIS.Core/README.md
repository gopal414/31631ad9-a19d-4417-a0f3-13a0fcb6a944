# Longest Increasing Subsequence

## Problem
Given a space-separated string of integers, return the longest increasing subsequence.
If multiple sequences exist, return the earliest one.

## Approach
- Dynamic Programming (O(n²))
- Maintains ordering
- Ensures earliest subsequence is returned

## Example

Input:
6 1 5 9 2
Output:
1 5 9

## Testing
Unit tests are provided using xUnit.
